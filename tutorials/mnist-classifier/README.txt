This script assumes that the VisualRBM Tools are in a directory listed in your global 
%PATH% variable.  We also assume that the folowing MNIST data files are located in the 
same directory as the schedule files and the run.bat file:
	
	mnist-train-images.idx
	mnist-train-labels.idx
	mnist-test-images.idx

To run this tutorial and build a classifier for the MNIST dataset, simply run
run.bat
